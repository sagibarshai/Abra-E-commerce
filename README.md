Responsive E-Commerce (SPA) with fully authentication that I build by my self. 
For the client there is an option to signup , signin, logout ,  add, remove and change quantity of products in the cart.
For the manager there is a special api with an option to edit, delete & add any product in a simple way.
This project was built with React , React router v6, Styled-components, Node.js, Express, Mongodb, Mongoose, the server hosted in Heroku and the client hosted in firebase.
During the project I worked with git and used feature branch for every task.
This was my first project that a build END TO END with 
backend and frontend technologies. 
That was very interesting project for me that taught me a lot about develop END TO END applications.


- run backend: cd frontend ~ npm start
